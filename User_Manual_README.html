    <h2><a name="welcome"></a>1. Welcome and Overview</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Welcome to the Reading Tree program!</h3>

        <p>This program is design to help instructors design a worksheet of different sounds to help students practice enunciation.
        <p>It is broken down into distinct groups of sounds, or phonemes, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>"oo" for school</li>
            <li>"oo" for book</li>
            <li>EU as /oo/ for Zeus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users begin by navigating a menu of high-level categories until they arrive at one of 250+ distinct sound groups.</p>
        <p>After selecting one of these groups, a new screen will display a list of all the words in that group, sorted by skill level.</p>
        <p>From this screen, users may begin building a list of words to be exported into a final worksheet viewable in their web browser.</p>
        <p>Users may add as many words as they like from any number of groups. When they are finished, a simple button click will allow</p>
        <p>them to select a location on their local file system where the worksheet will be saved for later viewing.</p>
        <p>From this bottom-level screen, users may also edit a particular list within the group, adding or deleting words as needed.</p>
        <h4><em>Lets get started!</em></h4>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="instructions"></a>2. Instructions</h2>

    <div class="section">
        
        <h3>The Main Menu</h3>

        <p>The Main Menu is where you start, from here you can navigate through the different categories such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vowel Sounds</li>
            <li>Prefix</li>
            <li>Suffix</li>
            <li>Contractions</li>
            <li>OO Sounds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once in the <em>Vowel Sounds</em> category, for example, you will navigate through a sub-category such as <em>A Sounds</em>.</p>
        <p>By continuing this process down through the categories hierarchy, you will eventually reach one of the final sound groups such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A-E Sounds</li>
            <li>A-I Sounds</li>
            <li>A-Y Sounds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking on any of these will take you to the <em>Levels Menu</em>.</p>
        <p>While moving through the categories, you may hit the "Back" button from any menu to navigate up one level.</p>
        <p>Some categories will have multiple sub-levels, but you can always choose "Main Menu" to start over from the beginning.</p>
        <img src="BackBtn.jpg" style="float:left;width:60px;height:40px;">
        <img src="MainMenuBTN.jpg" style="float:left;width:60px;height:40px;"><br /><br />

        <h3>The Levels Menu</h3>

        <p>Upon arriving at the <em>Levels Menu</em>, you will notice that one or more of the lists along the top of the screen are populated with words.</p>
        <p>These are all the words associated with the sound group selected, sorted into lists by skill level.</p>
        <p>Each of these lists corresponds with a radio button which can be used to select the level. This will come in handy when using the buttons on the lower portion of the screen.</p>
        <p>Below the lists of words, in addition to the "Back" and "Main Menu" buttons described above, you will see buttons labeled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain Selected Level</li>
            <li>Export Chosen Words</li>
            <li>Clear Chosen Words</li>
            <li>Choose Words from Selected Level</li>
            <li>Remove from Chosen Words</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these will be addressed here in turn.</p>

        <h4>Maintain Selected Level</h4>

        <p>Clicking this button will pop up a new window where you can make changes to the selected level, as indicated by the radio button immediately below the list</p>
        <p>This is the <em>Maintain Selected Level Menu</em>. In this window you are able to Add or Delete words from the selected level within the currently displayed sound group.</p>
        <p>To Add a word to the list, type the word into the text box just below the list of words and click the "Add Word" button. You will be prompted to confirm your choice</p>
        <p>and notified of the success or failure of the Add operation. Please make sure your word is not in the list already, as duplicates will not be added to the list.</p>
        <p>To Delete a word from the list, select the word in the list with your mouse cursor. The word will be highlighted in blue when it is selected. Then, simply</p>
        <p>click the button labeled "Delete Word". You will be prompted to confirm your choice and notified of the success or failure of the Delete operation.</p>
        <p>Once you are finished editing the list, you can click the button labeled "Return" to be taken back to the <em>Levels Menu</em> from which you came.</p>

        <h3>Building 'Your Chosen Words'</h3>

        <p>Before describing the rest of the functions of the <em>Levels Menu</em>, it is important to understand the intended use of this menu. After the program displays the</p>
        <p>lists of words in each level of the desired sound group, the program expects that the user will begin to build up a list of words by choosing them from one or more skill</p>
        <p>levels among the many sound groups supported by the program. As the user navigates the various categories and views the various sound groups, a list is created which will</p>
        <p>follow the user throughout their session in The Reading Tree. This list is known as th list of <em>Chosen Words</em> and it is displayed each time the user arrives at </p>
        <p>the <em>Levels Menu</em>. From here it can be modified by adding or removing words, cleared entirely, or exported into a worksheet. The remaining buttons on the <em>Levels Menu</em></p>
        <p>are used to manipulate this list of <em>Chosen Words</em>. In many ways the primary purpose of The Reading Tree is to build and ultimately export this list. Now that its</p>
        <p>purpose is clear, we can proceed to discuss the operations which affect it.</p>

        <h3>Adding to 'Your Chosen Words'</h3>

        <p>Adding to this list can be accomplished in one of two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You may double-click a word in the list and it will be added directly to "Your Chosen Words"</li>
            <li>You may add multiple words at random from the selected level by clicking the button labeled "Choose Words from Selected Level"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Double-clicking is fairly self-explanatory, but please note that you may not add a word which has been chosen previously. Duplicate entries will be ignored by the program.</p>
        <p>This leaves us with the only other option which is clicking the button labeled "Choose Words from Selected Level".</p>

        <h4>Choose Words from Selected Level</h4>

        <p>When you click this button, a new window will pop up prompting you to choose a number of words from the selected level. You can use the arrow buttons to increase or decrease</p>
        <p>the number of words to be chosen, or simply type in the number of words desired. When you are satisfied with the number displayed, click the button labeled "Confirm". The </p>
        <p>program will choose that many words at random and add them to 'Your Chosen Words'. If you decide you don't want any words from the selected level to be added, simply click</p>
        <p>the button labeled "Cancel" to return to the <em>Levels Menu</em>.</p>

        <h3>Removing words from 'Your Chosen Words'</h3>

        <p>There are three ways to remove a word or words from 'Your Chosen Words':</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can clear the entire list</li>
            <li>You can remove an individual word</li>
            <li>You can remove all the words from a particular sound group/level combination</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To clear the entire list, click on the button labeled "Clear Chosen Words" from the <em>Levels Menu</em></p>

        <h4>Clear Chosen Words</h4>

        <p>Clicking this button will produce a prompt which will ask you to confirm that you wish to remove all of the words from 'Your Chosen Words'. Once confirmed, this operation can't</p>
        <p>be reversed, so please take care when selecting this option. You can cancel at this prompt if you change your mind or if you clicked the button in error. All of the words you chose</p>
        <p>will still be accessible if you cancel from the confirmation prompt.</p>

        <h4>Remove from Chosen Words</h4>

        <p>Removing an individual word from 'Your Chosen Words' happens much the same as deleting a word on the <em>Maintain Selected Level</em> window. Clicking on a word in the list will</p>
        <p>cause the word to become highlighted in blue. Once the word is highlighted, clicking on the button labeled "Remove from Chosen Words" will produce a confirmation prompt. If you</p>
        <p>choose to proceed by clicking the button labeled "OK", the word will be removed and you will be returned to the <em>Levels Menu</em>. Clicking the button labeled "Cancel" or closing</p>
        <p>the confirmation dialog by clicking the red "X" button will return yo to the <em>Levels Menu</em> without making any changes to 'Your Chosen Words'.</p>

        <h4>Removing all words from a particular sound group/level combination</h4>

        <p>If you decide at any time that you would like to remove all of the words from a given sound group/level combination such as "A Sounds Level 1", this is done by clicking the same button</p>
        <p>as you would to remove an individual word. By selecting the group name within 'Your Chosen Words', and confirming it is highlighted blue, you would then click the button labeled "Remove</p>
        <p>From Chosen Words". A prompt will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to remove the group header. If you confirm, a new prompt will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to </p>
        <p>remove all words associated with that header from 'Your Chosen Words'. You can cancel the operation by clicking the button labeled "Cancel" at either prompt or by closing the prompt with</p>
        <p>the red "X" button on the prompt window. If you confirm your selection, all of the words from the selected group/level will be removed from 'Your Chosen Words' along with the group header.</p>
        <p>Again, it is worth noting that this operation can not be reversed once confirmed, so please be careful.</p>

        <h3>Finalizing 'Your Chosen Words'</h3>

        <p>After adding or removing all of the words required for a given student or lesson, all that remains is to save your list of chosen words to your file system. To do so, click the button</p>
        <p>labeled "Export Chosen Words" located on the <em>Levels Menu</em>.</p>

        <h4>Export Chosen Words</h4>

        <p>After clicking on this button, assuming 'Your Chosen Words' is not blank, you will be presented with a standard Windows 'Save As' dialog box. Simply navigate to the directory where you wish</p>
        <p>to save your worksheet and type in your preferred name for the file. Your list will be saves as an HTML file in the location selected and it will be divided into sections based on the sound</p>
        <p>group/level combinations of each chosen word. This HTML file can be opened in any text editor or web browser, but a web browser is preferred as it will display in a more pleasing format this way.</p>
        <p>Whether you end up saving your list or canceling from the 'Save As' window, you will be taken back to the <em>Levels Menu</em> where you have the option to continue building new lists of words</p>
        <p>until you are finished with the program.</p>

        <h3>Exiting The Reading Tree</h3>

        <p>If you wish to close the program, it is as simple as clicking the red "X" button in the upper-right hand corner of the window from any of these screens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Menu</li>
            <li>Any category or sub-category menu</li>
            <li>Levels Menu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking the red "X" button on any windows such as the <em>Maintain Selected Level</em> window or <em>Choose from Selected Level</em> window will simply return you back to <em>Levels Menu</em>.</p>
        <p>You will not be prompted to confirm your exit of the program, so please take care to export any worksheets you have created before exiting the application as they will be lost forever once the</p>
        <p>program closes.</p>

    <h2><a name="faq"></a>3. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Why are these broken down by sounds?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. The creators found that doing this reduced the amount of main groups and simplified navigating through the 250+ distinct groups supported by the program</p>
        <li>Can I create a new group?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. This verison of the Reading Tree program does not support new group creation, only the maintain list screen can edit a current group.</p>
        <li>Why am I able to add a word like Cat in the OO Sounds (Book) list?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. This Version does not support check for whether you are adding an appropriate word in the correct list. It will check for any duplicates, including capitalize words.</p>
        <li>How do I remove a certain word from my Chosen Word List?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. In the levels screen, you will want to select the word you wish to remove and it will highlight blue, once highlighted, click on Remove from Chosen Words, and it will remove that single word.</p>
        <li>Why are some levels blank in the Levels Screen?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. The program supports the idea behind a multi-level Category. As some catgegories have two levels assocaited with them. Future updates may include more multi-level Categories.</p>
        <li>If I quit the program, will I lose my Chosen Words list?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. Yes, once you exit the program, the data will be erased, and will need to be recreated.</p>
        <li>Does the Chosen Words List check for duplicates?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. Yes, the Chosen Words List will check for duplicates as well.</p>
    </ol>
