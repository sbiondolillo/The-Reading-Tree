<h2>I. Welcome and Overview</h2>
<p> Welcome to the Reading Tree program.
<p> This program is design to help facualty design a worksheet of different sounds to help students with enunceation.
<p> It is broken down into different groups of sounds, such as "oo" for school , "oo" for book, or EU as /oo/ for Zeus, and the list goes on.
<p> Once the sound group has been navigated the final screen will populate a list in that group with a coorelating level. 
<p> From there you may add as many words of any different groups to a separte list and export it as a worksheet. 
<p> You may also edit a particular group by deleting from the list or adding.
<p> Lets get started!</p>

<h2>II. Instructions</h2>

<p>The Main Menu is where you start, from here you can navigate through the different sounds categories such as OO Sounds.
<p> Once in the OO Sounds Category, you will navigate through a sub category such as OO (Book).
<p>If you happen to select the wrong category, you may hit the "Back" button to navigate up one as some Categories will have more options, or "Main Menu" to start over.

<p>Once at the Levels Screen, you will notice the Level 2 portion of the screen is populated with words. These are all the words associated with the Category selected and were assigned with a Level 2 difficulty, out of 5 levels.
<p>On the bottom half of the Screen you will see Maintain Selected Level, Export Chosen Words, Clear Chosen Words, Your Chosen Words, Choose Words from Selected Level, Remove from Chosen Words.
<p> The Maintain Selected Level will be discussed later, first we will talk about the other buttons on the bottom.
<p>You may double click a word in the list to add it to "Your Chosen Words" list. 
<p>This list is separate from the levels list, as it is your list.
<p>This list is retained throughout the time of using the program, which allows you to add words from different groups to "Your Chosen Words"
<p> This list can be exported to be presented as a worksheet.
<p>You may click on "Choose Words from Selected Level" to add a number of random words from the list.
<p>With the Chosen words list, you may Highlight a word that you wish to remove it with the "Remove from Chosen Words". This will only remove one word at a time.
<p>If you wish to Clear the entire Chosen Words list, simply click on the "Clear Chosen Words" and it will wipe the list.
<p>Once the list of your selection has been made, you may click on "Export Chosen Words" to then be prompted to save an html file.
<h4> Maintain Selected Level</h4>
<p> This is the Maintain Selected Level, in this separate screen you are able to Add or Delete words from the Category in which you previously navigated to.
<p> Simply by highlighting over the words in which you wish to delete and then hitting the "Delete Word" button, it will prompt you with a confirmation and proceed to delete or cancel.
<p> With the Box above the three buttons, you can add a word to the list. Simply type the word and then hit "Add Word".
<p> The program will check for duplicates and then proceed to add the word to the list.
<p>Once you have completed editing the list, you then can click "Return" to return to the levels screen.</p>

<h2> III. FAQ </h2>
<p>1.Why are these broken down by sounds?

<p>A.This Version does not support check for whether you are adding an appropriate word in the correct list. It will check for any duplicates, including capitalize words.

<p>5.Why are some levels blank in the Levels Screen?
<p>A.The program supports the idea behind a multi-level Category. As some catgegories have two levels assocaited with them. Future updates may include more multi-level Categories.
