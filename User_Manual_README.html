    <h2><a name="welcome"></a>1. Welcome and Overview</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Welcome to the Reading Tree program!</h3>

        <p>This program is design to help instructors design a worksheet of different sounds to help students with enunciation.
        <p>It is broken down into distinct groups of sounds, or phonemes, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>"oo" for school</li>
            <li>"oo" for book</li>
            <li>EU as /oo/ for Zeus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users begin by navigating a menu of higher-level groups until they arrive at one of 250+ distinct sounds.</p>
        <p>After selecting one of these sounds, a new screen will display a list of all the words in that group, sorted by skill level.</p>
        <p>From this screen, users may begin building a list of words to be exported into a final file viewable in their web browser.</p>
        <p>Users may add as many words as they like from any number of groups. When they are finished, a simple button click will allow</p>
        <p>them to select a location on their local file system where the final list of words will be saved for later viewing.</p>
        <p>From the bottom-level screen, users may also edit a particular list, adding or deleting words as needed.</p>
        <p>Lets get started!</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="instructions"></a>2. Instructions</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The Main Menu is where you start, from here you can navigate through the different sounds categories such as OO Sounds.</p>
        <p> Once in the OO Sounds Category, you will navigate through a sub category such as OO (Book).</p>
        <p>If you happen to select the wrong category, you may hit the "Back" button to navigate up one as some Categories will have more options, or "Main Menu" to start over.</p>
        <img src="BackBtn.jpg" style="float:left;width:60px;height:40px;">
        <img src="MainMenuBTN.jpg" style="float:left;width:60px;height:40px;">
        <p>Once at the Levels Screen, you will notice the Level 2 portion of the screen is populated with words. These are all the words associated with the Category selected and were assigned with a Level 2 difficulty, out of 5 levels.</p>
        <p>On the bottom half of the Screen you will see Maintain Selected Level, Export Chosen Words, Clear Chosen Words, Your Chosen Words, Choose Words from Selected Level, Remove from Chosen Words.</p>
        <p> The Maintain Selected Level will be discussed later, first we will talk about the other buttons on the bottom.</p>
        <p>You may double click a word in the list to add it to "Your Chosen Words" list.</p>
        <p>This list is separate from the levels list, as it is your list.</p>
        <p>This list is retained throughout the time of using the program, which allows you to add words from different groups to "Your Chosen Words"</p>
        <p>This list can be exported to be presented as a worksheet.</p>
        <p>You may click on "Choose Words from Selected Level" to add a number of random words from the list.</p>
        <p>With the Chosen words list, you may Highlight a word that you wish to remove it with the "Remove from Chosen Words". This will only remove one word at a time.</p>
        <p>If you wish to Clear the entire Chosen Words list, simply click on the "Clear Chosen Words" and it will wipe the list.</p>
        <p>Once the list of your selection has been made, you may click on "Export Chosen Words" to then be prompted to save an html file.</p>

        <h4> Maintain Selected Level</h4>

        <p>This is the Maintain Selected Level, in this separate screen you are able to Add or Delete words from the Category in which you previously navigated to.</p>
        <p>Simply by highlighting over the words in which you wish to delete and then hitting the "Delete Word" button, it will prompt you with a confirmation and proceed to delete or cancel.</p>
        <p>With the Box above the three buttons, you can add a word to the list. Simply type the word and then hit "Add Word".</p>
        <p>The program will check for duplicates and then proceed to add the word to the list.</p>
        <p>Once you have completed editing the list, you then can click "Return" to return to the levels screen.</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="faq"></a>3. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Why are these broken down by sounds?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. The creators found that doing this reduced the amount of main groups and simplified navigating through the 250+ distinct groups supported by the program</p>
        <li>Can I create a new group?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. This verison of the Reading Tree program does not support new group creation, only the maintain list screen can edit a current group.</p>
        <li>Why am I able to add a word like Cat in the OO Sounds (Book) list?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. This Version does not support check for whether you are adding an appropriate word in the correct list. It will check for any duplicates, including capitalize words.</p>
        <li>How do I remove a certain word from my Chosen Word List?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. In the levels screen, you will want to select the word you wish to remove and it will highlight blue, once highlighted, click on Remove from Chosen Words, and it will remove that single word.</p>
        <li>Why are some levels blank in the Levels Screen?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. The program supports the idea behind a multi-level Category. As some catgegories have two levels assocaited with them. Future updates may include more multi-level Categories.</p>
        <li>If I quit the program, will I lose my Chosen Words list?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. Yes, once you exit the program, the data will be erased, and will need to be recreated.</p>
        <li>Does the Chosen Words List check for duplicates?</li>
        <p class="answer">A. Yes, the Chosen Words List will check for duplicates as well.</p>
