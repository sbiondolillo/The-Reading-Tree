# The Reading Tree
A better way for speech therapists to build their lesson plans.

## Synopsis

This project was designed to provide a Windows Desktop GUI for speech therapists who were utilizing a group of Excel spreadsheets as a de facto database.

## Motivation

The Reading Tree was built for a course on *Computer Science in Action - Technology Innovations* at Manchester Community College in the Fall of 2017. The instructor was approached by a speech therapist who was frustrated with their current method of producing lesson plans. Using a series of Excel spreadsheets, each containing as many as 200+ lists of words, this therapist would individually select words to be grouped together and presented to students for practicing enunciation. What we built is our first attempt at providing this therapist with a more intuitive interface for selecting related groups of words and collating them into reasonable lesson plans.  
  
**This project is currently in a pre-release phase** and will be on hold until at least January 16, 2018. At that time, students of the course *Entrepreneurship in Computer Science* will extend this project based on user feedback into a new version suitable for final release.

## Installation

Please see the Release Notes for a given release for instructions on how to download and install this project. Generally, a .zip file will be provided with the compiled program which can be extracted and run on your local machine. The program is designed to be portable, running from a thumb drive on a Windows OS, so there is no installation utility provided.
